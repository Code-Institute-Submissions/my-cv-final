# My Web Developer Portfolio - Milestone Project #1

## Overview

For my first project with CodeInstitute, I have created my own online portfolio as a Full Stack Web Developer. It encloses key information about my recent projects, education and experience plus, ways to get in touch for further details. 

## UX

A responsive and clean portfolio is the easiest way to portray your abilities to potential employers. Plus, it provides an insight of what you could bring to companies and collaborations. 

The three main target audiences that this website aims at are:

1. Potential Employers: 
    *  This user type is looking to find more information about my work-experience and my developer skills. 


2. Pontential Co-workers:
    * This user type is looking to find links to my GitHub account and recent projects. They are also looking to enquire about my availability to be part of a collaboration project. 


3. Potential Internships:
    * This user type is similar to the first user type; they are mainly looking to find out more about my education and my skill pool as a Full Stack Developer. 

## Features

### Included Features

1. Profile Info Section: Provides a quick insight of who I am and what the user can find in my portfolio. 

2. Education + Experience Section: I have included a lock/unlock visual representation of which subjects I have covered and which ones are still to be learned. 
Both Profile Info and Education + Experience Section fall under the ABOUT page on the navbar.

3. Work Section: This section has medium snapshots of some of my projects and, for more details the user can follow the link to my GitHub page. 

4. Contact Section: A way to contact me for further details. 

5. Fixed Navbar: As this is a one-page portfolio, I have decided to add a fixed scroll bar to provide the user better navigation through different sections of the page. 

6. Screen Reader features such as the "alt" class for describing images and, the "aria-hidden" class for increasing icon accessibility. Plus, I prioritised the use of semantic elements to guarantee a more readible HTML structure.

7. Media queries at major breakpoints, - 700px, 600px, 425px and 320px. In order to ensure that the website is user friendly on all screen sizes. I have also included a bigger hero image which is only loaded when the 2000px breakpoint is passed.

### Features Left out

1. Interactive Snapshots on the Work Section: I would like to have added a pop-up window when the user clicks on one of the snapshots in the work section.
2. Contact Form: The contact form does not have an action address, as I do not have the skills to set up one yet. 

## Technologies Used

1. FontAwesome Icons 
    - https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
2. HTML5
3. CSS5
4. GoogleDev Tools
5. W3C Markup Validator

## Testing

1. Breakpoints

As I have mentioned above, I have included media queries at major breakpoints to 
make sure the website meets the standards of a Mobile First approach. 
And, for testing the functionality and appearence of my portfolio at different screen sizes, I used GoogleDev Tools. 

- On screens > 700px, the website's appearence flows more horizontally, with most elements being displayed inline. 
- On screens < 700px, the website's appearence flows more vertically, with most elements being displayed in block. 
This approach takes into account the narrower viewport of mobile phones. 

2. External Links and Navbar

    - Click on links to check if they direct you to the right website and/or section of the page.

3. W3C HTML Validator 

    - I used this tool to test the website's HTML structure and readibility.
