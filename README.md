# My Web Developer Portfolio - Milestone Project #1

## Overview

For my first project with CodeInstitute, I have created my own online portfolio as a Full Stack Web Developer. It encloses key information about my recent projects, education and experience plus, ways to get in touch for further details. 

## UX

A responsive and clean portfolio is the easiest way to portray your abilities to potential employers. Plus, it provides an insight of what you could bring to companies and collaborations. 

The three main target audiences that this website aims at are:

1. Potential Employers: 
    *  This user type is looking to find more information about my work-experience and my developer skills. 


2. Pontential Co-workers:
    * This user type is looking to find links to my GitHub account and recent projects. They are also looking to enquire about my availability to be part of a collaboration project. 


3. Potential Internships:
    * This user type is similar to the first user type; they are mainly looking to find out more about my education and my skill pool as a Full Stack Developer. 


I have used Wireframe.cc to display my first ideas on the basic elements of the page. The basic set up has remained the same, in the work section I decided not to include snapshots as they would take too much space. 
Some of the titles have changed and, the home and about page have merged to become one. You can access my wireframe here: https://wireframe.cc/J59sar 
## Features

### Included Features

1. Home Section: Provides a quick insight of who I am and what the user can find in my portfolio. 

2. Education Section: I have included this section just next to the projects section in order to provide a clear flow of information to the user.

3. Project Section: This section contains descriptive information about some of my projects, visual representation of what technologies I used. For more details the user can follow the link to my GitHub page and/or launch the live website. 

4. Contact Section: A way to contact me for further details. 

5. Fixed Navbar: As this is a one-page portfolio, I have decided to add a fixed scroll bar to provide the user better navigation through different sections of the page. 

6. Screen Reader features such as the "alt" class for describing images and, the "aria-hidden" class for increasing icon accessibility. Plus, I prioritised the use of semantic elements to guarantee a more readible HTML structure.

7. Media queries at major breakpoints, - 700px, 600px, 425px and 320px. In order to ensure that the website is user friendly on all screen sizes. I have also included a bigger hero image which is only loaded when the 2000px breakpoint is passed.

### Features Left out

1. Interactive Snapshots on the Projects Section: I would like to have added a pop-up window when the user clicks on the projects in the project section.
2. Contact Form: The contact form does not have an action address, as I do not have the skills to set up one yet. 

## Technologies Used

1. FontAwesome Icons 
    - https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
2. HTML5
3. CSS5
4. GoogleDev Tools
5. W3C Markup Validator

## Testing

1. Breakpoints

As I have mentioned above, I have included media queries at major breakpoints to 
make sure the website meets the standards of a Mobile First approach. 
And, for testing the functionality and appearence of my portfolio at different screen sizes, I used GoogleDev Tools. 

- On screens > 700px, the website's appearence flows more horizontally, with most elements being displayed inline. 
- On screens < 700px, the website's appearence flows more vertically, with most elements being displayed in block. 
This approach takes into account the narrower viewport of mobile phones. 

2. External Links and Navbar

    - Click on links to check if they direct you to the right website and/or section of the page.

3. W3C HTML Validator 

    - I used this tool to test the website's HTML structure and readibility.
