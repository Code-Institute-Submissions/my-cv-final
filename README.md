# My Web Developer Portfolio - Milestone Project #1

## Overview
___

For my first project with CodeInstitute, I have created my own online portfolio as a Full Stack Web Developer. It encloses key information about my recent projects, education and experience plus, ways to get in touch for further details. 

## UX
___

A responsive and clean portfolio is the easiest way to portray your abilities to potential employers. Plus, it provides an insight of which skills you could readily bring to companies and collaborations. 

The three main target audiences that this website aims at are:

1. Potential Employers: 
    *  This user type is looking to find more information about my work-experience and my developer skills. 


2. Pontential Co-workers:
    * This user type is looking to find links to my GitHub account and recent projects. They are also looking to enquire about my availability to be part of a collaboration project. 


3. Potential Internships:
    * This user type is similar to the first user type; they are mainly looking to find out more about my education and my skill pool as a Full Stack Developer. 

### Typography

This projects uses one single font: 'DM Mono'. 
It is easy to read and, it stands out well in different font weights and decorations. Plus, it resembles the fonts used for coding and software environments. 

### Colour Scheme

There are two main colours that decorate the background and the font colour:

- #333333
- whitesmoke

They are neutral and minimalistic colours so, that the important information to be found and taken out by the user is easy to spot. 
Also, these two colours in the background blend well with the colourful hero image. 

### Wireframes

I have used Wireframe.cc to display my first ideas on the basic elements of the page. The basic set up has remained the same, in the work section I decided not to include snapshots as they would take too much space. 
Some of the titles have changed and, the home and about page have merged to become one. You can access my wireframe here: https://wireframe.cc/J59sar 

## Features
___

### Included Features

1. Home Section: A clear welcome page displaying my full name and my job title to portray the main idea of this website to the user, as soon as they launch the website. As the user scrolls down, a quick description of who I am and what the user can find in my portfolio is provided. 

2. Education Section: I have included this section just next to the projects section in order to provide a clear flow of information to the user.

3. Project Section: This section contains descriptive information about some of my projects, visual representation of what technologies I used. For more details, the user can follow the link to my GitHub page and/or launch the live website. 

4. Contact Section: A way to contact me for further details. 

5. Fixed Navbar: As this is a one-page portfolio, I have decided to add a fixed scroll bar to provide the user better navigation through different sections of the page. 

6. Screen Reader features such as the "alt" class for describing images and, the "aria-hidden" class for increasing icon accessibility. Plus, I prioritised the use of semantic elements to guarantee a more readible HTML structure.

7. Media queries at major breakpoints, - 700px, 600px, 425px and 320px. In order to ensure that the website is user friendly on all screen sizes. I have also included a bigger hero image which is only loaded when the 2000px breakpoint is crossed.

8. Download my CV: I have included the option to download a copy of my CV to the user's computer for further information. This can be achieved by clicking on the icon farthest to the right on the website's nav bar.

### Features Left out

1. Interactive Snapshots on the Projects Section: I would like to have added a pop-up window when the user clicks on the projects in the project section.
2. Contact Form: The contact form does not have an action address; it is not live yet as it requires the knowledge of other languages.

## Testing
___

### Breakpoints

As I have mentioned above, I have included media queries at major breakpoints to 
make sure the website meets the standards of a Mobile First approach. 
And, for testing the functionality and appearence of my portfolio at different screen sizes, I used GoogleDev Tools. 

- On screens > 700px, the website's appearence flows more horizontally, with most elements being displayed inline. 
- On screens < 700px, the website's appearence flows more vertically, with most elements being displayed in block. 
This approach takes into account the narrower viewport of mobile phones. 

Testing for breakpoints:

1. Preview website on the browser
2. Right click --> Inspect (Open GoogleDev Tools)
3. Select the smallest breakpoint, 320px;
4. Scroll up and down, check for overflow, text-align and element's position. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 at each major breakpoint.
6. If possible, launch the live website on your mobile phone.  

### External Links, Download CV and Navbar

- Click on links to check if they direct you to the right website and/or section of the page.
- Check Download CV icon on the top right section of the navbar downloads a pdf file of my CV to the computer. 

Testing for links:

1. Preview website on the browser;
2. Start with the top most element of the page;
3. Click each link on the navbar and check if they direct you to the right place on the website;
4. Click each social link and check if they direct you to the right website on a new tab;
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 on every other link on the page;
6. Click on the top right "Download" icon in the nav bar;
7. A pdf file of my CV should download to the computer.
8. Repeat all steps on a mobile and tablet.

### Contact Form

- All fields are required to be completed by the user before they submit the form.

Testing for contact form:

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page or click 'Contact' on the navbar;
2. Fill every field but, one on the contact form;
3. Click 'Submit'
4. The message 'Please fill in this field' should come up.
5. Repeat the steps above on a mobile and a tablet.


### W3C Validator

- I used this tool to test the website's HTML and CSS structure and readibility.

2. Copy and paste the index.html file on this repository;
3. Click 'Check'.

Testing CSS Validator:
